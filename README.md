# 🚨 Incident Response Playbook  
> A practical, scenario-based guide for responding to cybersecurity incidents with precision, speed, and consistency  

---

## 🧠 Overview

The **Incident Response Playbook** is a structured guide designed to help cybersecurity teams, especially those in SOC environments, rapidly respond to common cyber threats. The playbooks include actionable steps across all four stages of incident handling as outlined by **NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2**:

1. **Preparation**
2. **Detection & Analysis**
3. **Containment, Eradication & Recovery**
4. **Post-Incident Activity**

Each playbook aligns with real-world threat scenarios and maps to relevant **MITRE ATT&CK techniques**, ensuring threat-informed defense practices.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Provide reproducible, consistent response strategies for common attack types
- Reduce MTTR (Mean Time to Respond) through automation and clear escalation
- Enable SOC analysts and incident responders to act quickly under pressure
- Build readiness and compliance alignment with NIST, ISO, and SOC 2

## 🧪 Response Lifecycle Template

Each `.md` file follows this structure:

```markdown
# [Incident Type]
## 🛑 Detection
- What signals/alerts trigger this response?
- SIEM rules, EDR alerts, user-reported indicators

## 🔒 Containment
- Steps to isolate infected assets
- Account lockdown, IP blocking, or host quarantine

## 🧹 Eradication
- Malware removal, patching, resetting credentials

## 🔄 Recovery
- Service restoration, monitoring post-cleanup

## 📝 Lessons Learned
- RCA (Root Cause Analysis)
- IR metrics, SOC dashboard update
